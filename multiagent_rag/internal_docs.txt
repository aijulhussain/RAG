Transformer Architecture — Overview

The Transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 in the paper “Attention Is All You Need.”
It revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by replacing recurrent structures (like RNNs and LSTMs) with a mechanism called self-attention, enabling models to process sequences in parallel and capture long-range dependencies efficiently.

Key Components

Encoder–Decoder Structure

Encoder: Processes the input sequence and converts it into a contextualized representation.

Decoder: Uses these representations to generate the output sequence (e.g., in translation tasks).

Self-Attention Mechanism

Allows each token to “attend” to other tokens in the sequence.

Helps the model understand relationships between words regardless of their distance.

Multi-Head Attention

Multiple attention heads capture different aspects of the word relationships simultaneously.

Positional Encoding

Since Transformers do not use recurrence, positional encodings are added to input embeddings to preserve the order of tokens.

Feed-Forward Network (FFN)

After attention, each token’s representation is passed through a small neural network to enhance feature learning.

Residual Connections & Layer Normalization

Improve gradient flow and model stability during training.

Advantages

Parallel processing → faster training

Better long-term dependency handling

Scalable and adaptable → forms the base of models like BERT, GPT, T5, etc.

Applications

In short:
The Transformer is a highly efficient sequence model based on attention mechanisms that has become the foundation of modern AI models in NLP, vision, and multimodal learning
